# This script is a simple Python program that prints "Hello, welcome to CIS 103"

# The print() function is used to display output to the console.
# The following line of code will print the string "Hello, welcome to CIS 103"

def main():
    # The following line of code will print the string "Hello welcome to CIS 103"
    print("Hello, welcome to CIS 103!")
    # The print() function is used to display output to the console

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
# This if __name__ == "__main__": block is used to ensure that the main()
# function is called only when this script is executed directly, and not
# when it is imported as a module.
# This line calls the main() function to execute the code within
